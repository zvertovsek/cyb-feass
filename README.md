This is a simple web form which validates and collect some user data and store it into firebase database.

I am using:
- React with webpack (create-react-app)
- Redux
- ant.d (UI controls)
- axios (for async requests)
- jest and enzyme (for testing)

Ran out of time to write more tests, but i managed to set them up and write one, jeej :)
About tests - i wanted to test all actions and reducers and compare snapshots on the UI.

setup:
* git clone https://github.com/zvertovsek/cyb-feass.git <folderName>
* cd <folderName>
* npm install
* npm start

for test:
* npm run test
